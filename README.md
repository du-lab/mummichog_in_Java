# mummichog_in_Java
Rewriting Mummichog from Python to Java

Mummichog was originally developed by Dr. Shuzhao Li at Emory University and was coded in Python (https://github.com/shuzhao-li/mummichog/blob/master/main.py). We are re-coding it into Java to make it easy to connect Mummichog to ADAP modules and incorporate it into MZmine 2.
